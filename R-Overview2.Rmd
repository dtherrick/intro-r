## What is R?

  > R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
  > It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.
  
  - From R's [home page](http://r-project.org):

- R itself has several components - not unlike Python, which many of you are familiar with.
- __Base R__ is the foundational component of the environment.
  * If we _only_ install this, we could:
    * Load data
    * Conduct some statistical analyses - including regression.
    * Save our results.
  * We couldn't:
    * Connect to databases or APIs.
    * Conduct more in-depth analyses.
    * Create publication-ready plots.
    * ...and much more.
- We extend R with __packages__ that we can install from inside the R environment.
  * Most packages live on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org)
  * As of this writing there are 7,649 packages.
  * They're installed by invoking `install.packages("<package_name")`
  * They're made available inside an R session using `library(<package_name>)`
- R works much better with an IDE that allows scripting, displays outputs - including plots.
- The preferred IDE is __RStudio__
  * It's an open-source IDE that makes R development __MUCH__ easier.

## Where can I get R?

* For the work we'll do tonight, we need to install both base R and RStudio:
  * Base R lives at [http://r-project.org](http://r-project.org)
    * At the top of the page, select the OS where you'll install R. Precompiled binaries are available for Windows, OS X, and various flavors of Linux.
    * The current version is __R 3.2.3 "Wooden Christmas Tree"__ and was released on 10-December-2015.
    * It's wise to keep your R installation up to date.
  * RStudio lives at [RStudio's](http://rstudio.com) site.
    * Select Products > RStudio > Desktop, or simply click this [link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) and download the open source edition.
  * Any additional packages we need, we can install as needed.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
